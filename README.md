# Introduction
## Problem Statement
The real estate market in Riyadh is growing rapidly, and with this growth comes a lot of data that needs to be understood. There's a need to figure out whatâ€™s driving property prices, how demand is changing, and what trends are emerging. However, the sheer volume of data can make it hard to see the bigger picture and make informed decisions.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze Riyadh's real estate data using advanced tools to make sense of it all. We want to answer important questions like what factors affect property prices and what trends are shaping the market. Through careful data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover insights that will help investors, developers, and policymakers make better decisions. In the end, we'll create an easy-to-understand report that clearly presents our findings in a story-telling format.


# Dataset Overview and Source

### Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Aqar website and is available on Kaggle.

- **Source:** [Riyadh Housing Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmanshir/riyadhhousingdata)
- **Description:** The dataset contains detailed information about housing in Riyadh, including attributes such as property prices, types, locations, sizes, and other relevant factors.

This dataset will be utilized to perform in-depth analysis and generate insights that can contribute to better decision-making in the Riyadh real estate market.


# List of EDA Steps Applied to Data

Throughout the project, we applied a comprehensive set of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) steps to ensure the data's quality and extract meaningful insights. Below is a list of the EDA steps we performed.

1. **Reliability**

2. **Timeliness**

3. **Consistency**

# The final ten insights with their charts

The pie chart shows the distribution of properties with either a Driver Room or a Maid Room in Riyadh. The chart indicates that 66.67% of the properties have a Maid Room, while 33.33% of the properties include a Driver Room. This suggests that Maid Rooms are more commonly found in Riyadh properties than Driver Rooms, potentially reflecting a higher demand or cultural preference for having a dedicated space for domestic workers.
