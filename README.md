# Introduction
## Problem Statement
The real estate market in Riyadh is growing rapidly, and with this growth comes a lot of data that needs to be understood. There's a need to figure out whatâ€™s driving property prices, how demand is changing, and what trends are emerging. However, the sheer volume of data can make it hard to see the bigger picture and make informed decisions.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze Riyadh's real estate data using advanced tools to make sense of it all. We want to answer important questions like what factors affect property prices and what trends are shaping the market. Through careful data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover insights that will help investors, developers, and policymakers make better decisions. In the end, we'll create an easy-to-understand report that clearly presents our findings in a story-telling format.

The pie chart shows the distribution of properties with either a Driver Room or a Maid Room in Riyadh. The chart indicates that 66.67% of the properties have a Maid Room, while 33.33% of the properties include a Driver Room. This suggests that Maid Rooms are more commonly found in Riyadh properties than Driver Rooms, potentially reflecting a higher demand or cultural preference for having a dedicated space for domestic workers.

The chart shows that room prices in Riyadh differ by location:

- **North Riyadh** has the highest average prices.
- **East Riyadh** also has high prices but less than North Riyadh.
- **South, West, and Central Riyadh** have lower average prices, with South Riyadh being the most affordable.

This suggests that the northern and eastern parts of Riyadh are generally more expensive compared to the southern, western, and central areas.

The chart displays the average price for 5-room properties across different locations in Riyadh:

- **North Riyadh** has the highest average price for 5-room properties, significantly higher than other areas.
- **East Riyadh** comes next, but with a much lower average price than North Riyadh.
- **Central, West, and South Riyadh** have even lower average prices, with **South Riyadh** being the most affordable.

This suggests that 5-room properties in North Riyadh are the most expensive, while the southern part of Riyadh offers the most budget-friendly options.

- **East Riyadh** follows but with a notably lower average price.

The chart compares the average prices of houses based on their age:

- Houses that are **less than 10 years old** have a higher average price, around 2,000,000.
- Houses that are **more than 20 years old** have a lower average price, slightly below 1,500,000.

This suggests that newer houses tend to be more expensive, while older houses are more affordable.
