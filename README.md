# Introduction
## Problem Statement
The real estate market in Riyadh is growing rapidly, and with this growth comes a lot of data that needs to be understood. There's a need to figure out what’s driving property prices, how demand is changing, and what trends are emerging. However, the sheer volume of data can make it hard to see the bigger picture and make informed decisions.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze Riyadh's real estate data using advanced tools to make sense of it all. We want to answer important questions like what factors affect property prices and what trends are shaping the market. Through careful data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover insights that will help investors, developers, and policymakers make better decisions. In the end, we'll create an easy-to-understand report that clearly presents our findings in a story-telling format.

The pie chart shows the distribution of properties with either a Driver Room or a Maid Room in Riyadh. The chart indicates that 66.67% of the properties have a Maid Room, while 33.33% of the properties include a Driver Room. This suggests that Maid Rooms are more commonly found in Riyadh properties than Driver Rooms, potentially reflecting a higher demand or cultural preference for having a dedicated space for domestic workers.

### Insight from the Chart

The scatter plot shows the relationship between property age and price across different locations in Riyadh:

- **North Riyadh** (red dots) shows a consistent presence across all age ranges with prices generally on the higher side.
- **West Riyadh** (light red) also appears frequently across all property ages, with prices similar to those in North Riyadh.
- **South Riyadh** and **East Riyadh** (blue shades) have properties mostly in the lower price range.

This suggests that property prices in Riyadh are influenced more by location than by the age of the property, with North and West Riyadh being more expensive regardless of property age.
